***DATABASE NORMALIZATION***
============================

Segmenting information into tabular form in a manner that will reduce data redundancy by allowing composite data to be produced by table joins.

There are many table forms

A spreadsheet is first normal form:  everything is on one sheet and many columns contain the same data.

In practice, I have only used 3rd normal form.
