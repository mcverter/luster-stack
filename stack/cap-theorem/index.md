CAP THEOREM
===========

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem)
In theoretical computer science, the CAP theorem, also named Brewer's theorem after computer scientist Eric Brewer, states that it is impossible for a distributed data store to simultaneously provide more than two out of the following three guarantees:

* Consistency: Every read receives the most recent write or an error
* Availability: Every request receives a (non-error) response â€“ without guarantee that it contains the most recent write
* Partition tolerance: The system continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped (or delayed) by the network between nodes


No distributed system is safe from network failures, thus network partitioning generally has to be tolerated. In the presence of a partition, one is then left with two options: consistency or availability.
